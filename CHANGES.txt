UP
=====

    - fix bug in pretend

      When minimerge upgrade (easy_install -U), we have now the infrastructure to run update callbacks.
    - Now minibuilds have revisions, this can facilitate their reinstallation as reverse dependencies
    - give means to select the python to build against for python modules (--all-python-versions or specify python to use along with the package (minimerge -pv foo python-2.4)
    - force eggs category reinstallation
    - add an only dependencies switch to buld only dependencies
    - win32 compatibility (first rush, alpha quality)
    - add replace/per/os/dependencies mecanism in minibuilds
    - allow minibuild names with only major as version
